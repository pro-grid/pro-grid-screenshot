pro-grid-screenshot
===================
By Darren Cattle and Austin Pray

The purpose of these simple scripts is to allow a server to capture pro-grid and then publically display the .png files into a web page.

We wish we could use webkit2png but it is for mac only which revokes the practicality of running a server.

Install firefox and crontab for compatibility.
